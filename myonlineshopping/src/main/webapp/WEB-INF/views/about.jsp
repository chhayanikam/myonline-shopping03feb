      				<h4>To blend, intermingle, merge, infuse, interweave, amalgamate..</h4>
      				<p><i>While all brands have a story, not all stories become a brand!</i></p>
      				<p>As a storyteller I was adept at weaving tales and interpreting life in my own individual way. Same
with my wardrobe. Adding a quirky patch, stitching a sari from a salwar suit piece, creating own
wardrobe from fabrics bought from all states.</p>
<p>And then came the voice of Inspiration, the nudge of persuasion, the lilt of Love: He said, your
designs are your signature, your persona, your echo. They must travel afar, embrace more hearts,
enrich more wardrobes. The infusions and the bold strokes should be owned by more likeminded
women to explore novel creations. And the seeds were sown.</p>
<p>No wonder each  creation has a story threaded in it. A Karnataka fabric gets a Manipuri palla, a
Bengal silk marries Phulkari from Punjab, a Dabu sari shows off an Ikkat border, a Taant sari gets
framed in Banarasi handwoven border a simple Maxi flaunts Kathakali faces, another dress sways
with Shibori pleats, a full- flared skirt preens with colourful boho tassels, a kaftan sashays with
blocked prints and cheeky slits, a Zari top doubles up as a sari blouse too !</p>

      			<h2 class="titleFont ">Love Stitch</h2>
      				<p>While we are creating memorable style-rich new moments, and treading oh so softly upon your precious memories lane. What happens to your 'godh-bharaayi' sari, your favourite but now bit
frayed kanjeevaram dupatta, your mom's priceless sepia wedding ghaghra set, your grandpa's
shandaar achkan, your daughter's miniature frock with ducklings on pockets your ancestral home's
threaded wall hanging, or the remains of your first hand-made table-cloth ?</p>


<p>We are most happy to re-make them into a new avatar, may be a new sari with your vintage border,
a new kurta with your dad's old kurta embroidered neckline, a pouch from your old dupatta, a
blouse from your favourite but now frayed anarkali</p>


<p>Stitched lovingly with care and sheer joy, we offer this unique initiative to all Pirona patrons who
sign up as our members and who make purchases worth or above Rs 10,000/-</p>

<p>Our Love Stitch Design Team will discuss the options of up-cycling your favourite old piece on a call
or WhatsApp and once decided, we will arrange to collect your piece from your doorstep. We will
ship the newly made piece with your next purchase as a heart-warming gift from us. All this at bare
minimum cost, to cover actual expenses like lining, tailoring and any embellishments if required.</p>

<p>So, go ahead, take out all your lovingly preserved pieces and get ready to embrace and flaunt them
again - in a new look and a new feel! Let those cherished memories breathe and live on  gifted to
you  Love Stitch!</p>
